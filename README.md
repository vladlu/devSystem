# Rules
  
### Formatting
 
1. The very first line of the rules file should contain either "plugin" or "theme" string.

2. At least one tab between items. You can add additional tabs and spaces to give it beautiful formatting.
3. You can use comments in any desired format — only the lines that contain one of the rules will be interpreted.

 
### The list of available rules
 
    substitute
        dev_mode_text  prod_mode_text  file
 
    copy
        from  to
 
    uglifyjs
        from  to  [common_directory]
 
    webpack
        from  to  [common_directory]
        
    install
        npm_module_name
 
### What does `webpack` rule do?
 

    JS:  babel (with minification)
    CSS: autoprefixer -> cssnano


### Expansions

* `[m]` – dev/wp-prod/wp-prod/webpack/node_modules

### Notes
 
  - Rules are updated only on the prod stage (`to_prod.sh`), so `to_dev.sh` always works
   with the rules generated by `to_prod.sh`.

  - for `uglifyjs` and `webpack` rules:   
  
    `from` files are created automatically on the prod stage, by renaming the `to` option file if none of them has `dev/` in the beginning.
